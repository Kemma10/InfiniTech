# InfiniTech

InfiniTech was approached by a client who wants a customised notepad app for their music students.

We should be able to perform basic note-taking features such as creating, saving and printing notes with the app. It should also allow them to perform basic editing features such as undo, redo, cut, copy and paste.

As a company that uses agile methodology in developing software, the Product Owner has produced the product backlog based on the client's requirements. The notepad app should have two menus, File and Edit. Under each of these two menus.
